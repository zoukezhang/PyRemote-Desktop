I will prepare your project for GitHub publication by making it professional and complete.

### Steps I will take:
1.  **Update `requirements.txt`**: Ensure all dependencies (like `customtkinter`, `mss`, `pyautogui`) are listed so others can install it easily.
2.  **Create `.gitignore`**: Prevent junk files (like `.DS_Store`, `__pycache__`, local configs) from polluting your GitHub repo.
3.  **Upgrade `README.md`**: Rewrite the documentation to highlight the **"Pro" features** we just built:
    *   🚀 **High Performance**: 60FPS, Low Latency, Hardware Scancodes.
    *   🛡️ **Admin Mode**: Lock Screen Control & UAC Bypass.
    *   📂 **File Transfer**: Drag & Drop support.
    *   🔧 **Smart Tools**: Auto-Firewall Fix, Ngrok Tunneling.
4.  **Initialize Git**: Create the local repository and commit the code.

### What you need to do (after I finish):
I will give you the **exact 2 lines of code** to copy-paste into your terminal to push it to your GitHub account (since I don't have your GitHub password).
